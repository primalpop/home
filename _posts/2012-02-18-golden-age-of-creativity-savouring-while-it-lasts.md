Few days back, I watched the movie ["Midnight in
Paris"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/) by Woody Allen. 
The protagonist of the movie always wished to travel back in time to Paris of
the 1930s, which for him, was the golden age of creativity. And 
suddenly he was in 1930(no questions asked) with Ernest Hemingway and the
alike, he discovers that the people of that time wished to be a part of 1890s
which they considered as the golden age. Its an alright movie, but it had a
brilliant point well put forward that people dont realize themselves being part
of golden age, its generation afterwards that discovers it. Then its
too late already.

If you have seen [Zeitgeist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1166827/), you already know the fallacies of the 'real world'
we are part of. By taking down the World Trade Center and 10,000 lives, US
government made sure that it could take control of the life of their citizens
completely. The more I look around, I realize that world is driven forward by
fear rather than love. This is ideal for governments and religious dogmas,
which strive to divide people. 

Where does that leave us? In the 'real world' where the freedom is defined the
very insitutions that deny it, lets roll over to the Virtual world -
**Internet** which on virtue of its lack of structure and centralized control has
largely remained free in the real free sense. [Dictators have
fallen](http://smedio.com/2011/02/04/how-twitter-is-helping-with-the-egyptian-revolution/),
[fallacies have been exposed](http://wikileaks.org/) and [evil plots have been
thwarted](http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/20/sopa-stopped-after-unprecedented-online-protests/)
through this medium of speech.


But Governments are trying hard
to instill fear upon the netizens by taking down that World Trade Center of the
online world and forcing people to surrender their freedom in return for security.
[SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) and
[PIPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) may have failed now but with ever reducing attention span of the
people, the US government is sure to pull it through in the second or third
time. Soon other countries will follow suit and together with [various
censorships](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204542404577158342623999990.html#ixzz1jVPdAsNT), Internet as we know will cease to exist.

So before all that happens, realize for yourself that we are part of a golden age of
creativity and it is not going to last forever. Savour the freedom while it
lasts by enjoying what we have and excercising the right of opinion. Let me end
this soliloquy with a quote from Zeitgiest,

**The most incredible aspect of all: these totalitarian elements will not be
forced on people, the people will demand them.**
