First let me apologize if I got you on the wrong foot. This post isn't about how to master procastination but it's rather about how I learned the art of procrastination during the last four years as an undergraduate student at the [University of Calicut](http://universityofcalicut.info). I can safely presume this is the experience of thousands of students who were lucky enough to study here. As you may have guessed already this isn't a direct course offered by the  University but comes as an added bonus irrespective of the course a students enrolls to. So most probably joining this university for higher studies would mean that one will eventually find the dragon scroll for a being a Pro(crastinator).

[University of Calicut](http://www.universityofcalicut.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=336) is one of most sought after universities in the state of Kerala with 25 Departments of postgraduate studies and research, under its direct control and 191 affiliated colleges spread across the five northern districts of Kerala–Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Wayanad – serving about 2.75 lakh students every year. That's one impressive statistic if you ask me. The only problem comes with the Examination system of the University. Over the years it had the most profound impact on bringing out the best procrastination skills in students.

There is a **well defined procedure **for how the University conducts or rather announces the examinations. There are many unwritten rules(uw) which guide the conductance of these exams. (I wonder why these are unwritten yet as I found only these to be strictly followed by the University.)


1. First an exam is declared through [a notification in the website](http://www.universityofcalicut.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=744&Itemid=324). Most of the times it would be when students of other universities are waiting for their results.  As an unwritten rule this happens 3 weeks before the examinations. I guess this is supposed to reduce the trauma of students by letting them know early of the crisis ahead. Here starts a period of procrastination and speculation which ends with examination "really" starting off.

2. [Timetable for the examinations](http://www.universityofcalicut.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=745&Itemid=325) comes a week after the notification. This should ideally get the blood flowing into the brains. Of course it does, but for other reasons. The speculation of whether the exam would be postponed begins and this soon ends with a positive result. The only remaining question is Why? Really interesting theories come up of why it should be postponed. From the death of Osama Bin Laden to local political thug being attacked, everything counts.

Next few days, everyone will be busy scouring through every page in the newspaper for the reason of postponement or discussing with their friends in other colleges. Finally after a lot of brainstorming and researching, probable reasons would be churned out. These candidate reasons spread from college to college and it wouldn't be long before everyone(maybe except those who scheduled exams) know why exams wouldn't take place on the declared date.

Sometimes the first exam date would collide [Harthal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartal) declared by any political party making it easier for students as well as the University to know why it would be postponed.

Mostly it would be because of the conflicts within the University. For example, Suppose the Semester 8 supplementary exam results are yet to be announced(after having conducted them ages ago) and this would mean the students who fail in this exam cannot take part in the examinations already declared. Another example of internal conflict/complexity would be when the Interzone(College Youth Festival) date falls on the same date. Now the very reasonable question why doesn't those who schedule examinations overlook these facts? I would rather answer whether chicken or egg came first.

3. I would call the period following the announcement of timetable to when the exam is really postponed 'the suspense period'. It really is, considering how unreliable our politicians and administrators are. Most of us would wait until 2-3 days before exam before giving up hope of postponement. Brave hearted souls would battle till the penultimate day before hitting the books and cursing the university.

Now when does the University actually postpone the Examination. It can happen anytime. There has been an instance in which the exams of Production Engineering students were postponed after they were in the exam hall. They were informed after sitting in the exam hall for about 1 hour(without the question paper of course) that the exams were postponed. In very extreme cases, it can get postponed(or better call cancelled) even after students have written the exam and the reasons(once it was because the question paper for the exam was the same as of that a previous year) given would make you bang your head to death. Now as a probable solution if someone considered contacting the University on their given number , you will greeted with either a busy tone or long period of ringing with none picking up

With lots of holidays in between exams it would take at least 3 weeks to complete 5 exams. That gives an estimate how 'quick' it gets over once it's started and it's not surprising that it takes nearly 5 years for obtaining an undergraduate degree from the University. Examination results are always delayed and a mess. You never know what's the University got in store for you with results. With revaluations taking over one year to complete(and considering the history of University's paper valuing theatrics) most would accept failure as their destiny even though deep down they knew they had written the exams well.


With that I am  cutting it short as I am under the danger of procrastination myself now by writing this post.  Please leave your feedback on the post in the comments.
