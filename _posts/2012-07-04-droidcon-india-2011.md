Undocumented memories fade away and some of the memories are too valuable to let them
escape into the oblivion. This post is the documentation of my experience at [Droidcon India](http://droidcon.in/2011/) which
happened at Bangalore in November 2011. By laying out in words, I am hoping to preserve the  memory
of an amazing experience I had at the conference.

In [summer of 2011](http://primux.in/projects/2012/02/06/summer-of-11-story-of-my-gsoc-application/), I was busy coding [tagin!](http://wiki.mobile-accessibility.idrc.ocad.ca/w/Tagin!) which is an Indoor Location 
Tagging Engine for Android. Towards the end of Google Summer of Code 2011, I came across the 
announcement of Call for Papers(CFP) for first ever International Android conference in India, 
Droidcon 2011. It was organized by the awesome folks at [hasgeek](http://hasgeek.com/) and [Bangalore Android User's Group](http://www.meetup.com/blrdroid/).
They had come up with an ingenious way of selecting talks for the conference. Basically, all the submitted 
talks were added to a [funnel](http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/) and talks with highest number of votes was considered for 
review  by expert panel and afterwards selected for presentation.

As luck had it, [my proposed talk](http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/70-indoor-location-tagging-engine) got a healthy number of upvotes. Few days after the 
deadline for CFP when the [schedule of the conference](http://droidcon.in/2011/schedule/) came out, 
my talk was part of it. I was ecstatic(rightly so) but nervous as well because conference was happening 
just 3 days away from my GRE exam. But this was an opportunity which I didn't want to miss hence I 
decided to go for it.

Since the presentation was about something I had worked on, making slides was easy. 
The tougher part was to find analogues to explain some of the concepts used in the project. 
My GSoC mentor, Jorge Silva's feedback was very helpful in this aspect. He also gave 
some invaluable insight on how to refine the slides and make my presentation better. You can see the slides I used 
for the talk here.

Upon reaching Bangalore, I straightaway headed to where my friends were staying in Bangalore.
They were generous to accomodate me at their place and sponsor my dinner for all the three days
I had stayed there.  Having been previously to Bangalore, I knew about the crazy traffic jams there, 
but never would have guessed it would take around 2.5 hours to cover 30 kms.The ordeal of a long train journey in 
the previous night coupled with this experience started to take it's toll. Therefore after watching few talks, I skipped the 
evening party and headed back to catch some sleep.

The next day, I was better prepared and started early for the conference. This time I reached the venue
in flat 30 mins even before the Organizers had turned up. My talk was scheduled in the afternoon, 
therefore I attended some of the talks that was happening in the morning. 

My talk started at 1.45 and contrary to my expectations, a lot of people had turned up. :)
I ended up taking the entire 45 minute slot for presenting my work, leaving no time for Q and A. 
Talking to some startup guys after my presentation I came to know that few others 
were working on a similar products as well. All in all, my first talk at an International Conference
went well. 

Later in the day, I roamed around in the Garden city. I also went to Blossoms book shop which was famous
for selling second hand books at very low prices. With a bag full of books and mind full of good memories
I boarded the train back to Thrissur.
