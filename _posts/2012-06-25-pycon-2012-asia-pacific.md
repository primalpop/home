As mentioned in [one of the earlier
posts](http://primux.in/General/2011/09/09/salaam-bombay/), I am presently at IIT Bombay working
as a Research Assistant in the Free and Open Source Software for Indian
Engineering Education(FOSSEE) project. Earlier on in March we, myself and 
Parth Buch(FOSSEEmate) dared to do something that was very ambitious. We
submitted a talk proposal at PyCon Asia Pacific(APAC) 2012 
which was happening at Singapore. The topic of the talk was "FOSSEE:
Pythonizing the Indian Engineering Education". Much to our surprise, we found
that [our talk](http://apac.pycon.org/2012/w/page/talks#talk_24) was selected
when the schedule was out in the mid of May. But with the kind of expenses
involved for travel and accomodation, going to Singapore for the conference
looked improbable. Thanks to the support from Prof.
Madhu Belur and IRCC office at IIT Bombay we finally had sufficient funds to go for the
conference.

This was our first travel across the borders and we both underestimated the
things to be done before the trip. At the cost of sacrificing sleep on the
penultimate day we could get most of the important things out of the
way(Insurance, Accomodation, International Travel card, Singapore sim card).
Finally on June 5th early morning we took off from CSI Airport Mumbai to Singapore. After
touching down at Changi Airport we straightaway went to [Fernloft,
Eastcoast](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Fernloft-East-Coast/Singapore/7770?source=adwordsdynamic&kid=569286&aid=2&gclid=COWaroW16bACFUcb6wod0kGqzA)
where we had booked a dorm earlier. That day evening and the next day was 
mostly spent in sleeping and preparing for the talk. 

On June 6th morning, we got up early in the morning and took the train to
Woodlands where, Republic Poly Technique, the venue of conference was located.
Morning was spent in attending the tutorial on [Big Data
Analysis](http://apac.pycon.org/2012/w/page/tutorials#tut_9). 
In the afternoon we got out and went to Little India(India within Singapore) to have some
Indian food which we have been craving since last 3 days.

On June 8th, second day of the conference we reached early to catch the 
keynote of Alex Martelli on "Permission and Forgiveness". Afterwards we
attended some good talks like "Python and the Web", "Fun with Iterators and
Generators" etc before our talk was up in the evening. The audience for our
talk was lower than what we had expected but those who were present actively asked doubts and
gave suggestions on where to improve. It was interesting to know that the
countries(Singapore, Europe, US)  where the people in the audience belonged to 
had no similar projects to promote Python or Free and Open Source Software(FOSS).
Few of them offered their support in creating Spoken Tutorials and a lady from
Singapore Education Department talked to us a long time afterwards on
implementing some of the projects in their educational ecosystem. The full talk
can be seen below.

Slides used for the talk can be seen 
[here](http://www.slideshare.net/primal007/pythonizing-the-indian-engineering-education). If you wish to see other talks
at PyCon APAC, heres the [playlist of
talks](http://www.youtube.com/user/pyconapac?feature=results_main) presented at the conference. 

The feedback on this video has been amazing until now. 
The PyCon APAC experience gave me the insight that our work at FOSSEE would be useful 
just not for Indian Engineering students but also for people from other countries 
as well who are interested to know and learn about FOSS and Python. As promised
in the video we are working on getting the web application for Spoken Tutorials
ready which would make the experience of learing much more interactive.
