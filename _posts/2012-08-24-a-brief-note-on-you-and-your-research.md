This post is an attempt to summarize the important points of the talk 'You and Your Research' delivered by **Dr. Richard W Hamming** at a seminar in the Bell Communications Research Colloquia Series. The talk tries to answer the question of **How to do
first class research**, the kind of research that fetch nobel prizes and eternal greatness. 
As Dr. Hamming himself says at the beginning of the talk 'It is not about managing research, it is about how you individually do your research.'

* Great work is not done by luck. The *prepared mind* sooner or later finds something important and does it. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not. 

* Have independent thoughts and foster the *courage* to pursue them. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. 

* *Age is not important* in the way you think it is. People always say that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it. History has a lot of examples to support this proposition. But what really happens in those examples is that people did some good work when they were young and found themselves on all kinds of committees and being unable to do any more work. When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems.

* What most people think are the best working conditions, are most often not so. People are often most productive when working conditions are bad. The ones you want aren't always the best ones for you. What appears to be a fault, often, by a *change of viewpoint*, turns out to be one of the greatest assets you can have.

* *Knowledge and productivity* are like compound interest. Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity.

* Importance of *the trait of ambiguity*. If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires a lovely balance. When you find apparent flaws you've got to be sensitive and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them. Those are often the great contributions.

* Creativity comes out of your subconscious. When you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the *center of your attention* - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free. 

* Ask yourself these questions: What are the *important problems* in my field? What important problems am I working on? And most importantly  If what I am doing is not important, and if I don't think it is going to lead to something important, why am I working on it? If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work.

*  You can't always know exactly where to be, but you can *keep active* in places where something might happen. Stand on a mountain top where lightning strikes; you don't have to hide in the valley where you're safe. Think hard hard about where your field is going, where were the opportunities, and what were the important things to do.

* *Keep your door open while working*. You might be less productive than the one who keeps the door closed due to all kinds of interruptions. But occassionally one gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.

* *It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it*. By changing the question around, you can do important work rather than trivial work. Obey Newton's rule and climb up the shoulders of giants and see further than they did. Instead of solving isolated problems, work on building solutions that others can build on top of it.

* *It is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it*.  You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks. In cases where you haven't got control on what you have to work on, it means you are not selling ideas to the top management.

Towards the end of talk Dr.Hamming explains why people with great promises sometimes fail inspite of being better equipped to do productive work. The following points outlines **the ingredients for becoming a first class researcher according to him.** 

1. Drive and Commitment. Outstanding work requires outstanding commitment.
2. Learn to work with the system and take advantage of all what it has to offer. You have to choose between reforming the system or doing first class science. 
3. Look at the positive side of things. 

He concludes his talk by saying 

> "The reasons why many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: 
> they don't work on important problems, 
> they don't become emotionally involved, 
> they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, 
> and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't."

I hope this post inspires to do first class work in whatever field you are. This is not an exact subsitute for reading the entire transcript of the talk and I would recommend that you do that [here](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~finin/YouAndYourResearch.html) if time permits.
