We all proudly say that ours is a democratic country and the leaders who rule us are chosen by us. It's true to an extent, that through elections we choose our government. Elections ensure that it is indeed from the people and for the people but how much is it by the people. Certain statistics will reveal an interesting truth

I am sticking with **Kerala** state assembly elections for this analysis; mainly because the most interesting results came out in this state and marginally because its my state. UDF did win over the opposition and will form the government. But how many people did really want an UDF government for the next 5 years? Well, the best way to answer this question is analysing the facts and that's what I am going to do.

According to Census India 2011, the population in Kerala is _3,33,87,677_ or nearly _3.33_ crores. Now Indian Constitution doesn't let all of these people to cast their votes. A voting age i.e a minimum age established by law that a person must attain to be eligible to vote in a public election, in India is _18_. The fate of Kerala would be decided by the _2.31_ crores of eligible voters. But not everyone of those who are eligible did exercise their civic duty. The average polling percentage in Kerala was _74.5%_. This is relatively than some other states in India but considering the high literacy rate(94.59%) in Kerala this should not be the case. Now translating the percentage into numbers, we come to conclusion that 1,72,09,500 voters did cast their votes.

Now turning our focus onto the results of the election, UDF won _72_ seats out of the total _140_. That's just one more than _71_ required for the majority. Going into share of votes, UDF got  80,02,854 (80 lakhs) votes which is _46.03_ percent of the total vote share and the main opposition party got _78,34,334_ (78.3 lakh) votes which turns out to be _45.06_% of the vote share. That's a meagre _34.6_% of the total votes(considering all the eligible voters). Only one out of every three Keralite voted for the soon-to-be ruling government. How can we call this "by the people"?

In case you thought I am against democracy, you got it completely wrong. I am a firm supporter of the democratic process and will continue to be. But these facts shows a very sad aspect of democracy in our state and the scene at national level isn't much different too. The solution doesn't lie in changing the system but rather the mindset of the voters.  I don't suggest that everyone should vote for the same party but everyone should indeed vote and be a part of the democratic process. But it should not be the only duty of a citizen during the five years to the nation rather it should be the first step. Voice your concerns, protests, suggestions either online or offline and make sure the government knows it. Thus let's have a democracy in it's full meaning.
