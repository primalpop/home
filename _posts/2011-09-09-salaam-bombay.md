This post has been cooking for a long time, too long that even I forgot at times that it was on the gas.  I have prepared to spill the beans and publish this post today and thereby overcome my obsession with delaying everything for betterment. So yes, I am in Bombay and to be exact in [IIT Powai](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). I a Research Assisstant in Free and Open Source Software in Science and Engineering([fossee](http://fossee.in)) project in the Aerospace Department. 

After completing my undergraduate studies I was confused about my immediate commitment  between job and higher studies. I knew deep down that once I joined a company, it would be hard for me to break out of the system and pursue my higher studies at a latter point of time. That's when [Pramode](http://pramode.net) Sir, my teacher and guide introduced me to FOSSEE and after few days of thought I was certain that it should be my calling. After one week of goodbyes and packaging, I flew to Bombay.

I had huge expectations of the place and so I was here even before my [GSoC](http://code.google.com/soc/) project got over because I felt that the IIT atmosphere would be more conductive to work than being at home. But it was far away from a smooth ride after reaching IIT. The first of the  problems was accomodation. I had to move around with my luggage to some 5 rooms during a period of 3 weeks before I got settled. 

The food was the second calamity. The mouth watering mess menu was a hoax and the [Tansa](http://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~tansa/) hostel mess was worst of all the 15 hostels in IIT. Until reaching here, I never knew I would miss food at home so badly and my mother's constant pushing to eat at time. Language problem was significant barrier too. Even though I had learned 8 years of Hindi at school, I can hardly speak the language. I can understand what people say, but I get stuck when I try to reply in Hindi back to them. The underlying fact, that I was staying away from the home for the first time magnified my miseries and at one point I even thought of returning back to my home. But giving up was never an option. ;)

After almost an month of survival, most of the problems stands resolved now and I got one of the better rooms in Tansa and a likeable but slightly lunatic roomie. I chose to ate food from the canteen and stuck to a constant dish to save my stomach from getting used to problems. Language problem still persists but my inhibition to speak hindi has reduced much and I can get by with English at most places. 

Looking back at the past one month, I am happy that I had to face all these problems because I made some good friends during the period of crisis. My college mate Alex Poovathingal's presence was always comforting and Fossee team members especially Anand Ramachandran and Deepak Kharat in spite of having to suffer my constant whining, were always helpful and understanding. Principal Investigators of the project, [Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran](http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~prabhu/) and [Prof. Madhu Belur](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/belur) were very friendly and gave me ample freedom and time to complete my gsoc project. There are lot of other people who also helped me either through comforting words(calls/chat) or by friendly demeanor at various points during my stay at Mumbai.  Even though I have not mentioned them my name in this post for fear of missing anyone, I would like to thank each of them.

During the few times, I had gone out of IIT, to the outside city of rush and chaos I understood the spirit that drives Mumbaikars despite frequent blasts and a population density that the infrastructure(of the city) can barely contain. Like one of famous phrases in business world 'The show must go on', the city and it's people never stops and the show goes on with an indomitable spirit that can never be subdued by fear.
