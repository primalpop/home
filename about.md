Primal is a Graduate student in Computer Science at University of Maryland,
Baltimore County[UMBC](http://umbc.edu/). He is part of [Ebiquity](http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/)  research lab and working with
Dr. Anupam Joshi in the research areas of Mobile Computing, 
Health Care and Context Aware Computing.  

He completed his B.Tech in computer science from [Government Engineering College
Thrissur](http://gectcr.ac.in/) in 2011 during the time which he also participated in Google Summer of Code 
and contributed to an open source project. He was also part of the [FOSSEE team](http://python.fossee.in/) 
at IIT Bombay for an year, working to promote usage of Python in Engineering education. During the summer 
of 2013 he is working as Software Engineer at [Picwell](http://picwell.com), an early stage startup in Philadelphia.

He considers himself as an avid FOSS enthusiast and most of his coding work can be 
seen on [github](https://github.com/primalpop). He does most of his coding in Python 
and Java. He has experience in 
developing mobile and web applications and is interested in learning everything Computer Science. 

He has been bitten by the [travel bug](https://foursquare.com/user/8054644) recently and never misses a chance to
explore new places. He has also picked up cooking during this time and can prepare a delicious
Beef curry among other Indian dishes. Running a 5K, picking up a music instrument, learning
a foreign language are some of the less crazier things in his bucketlist.
